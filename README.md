Hey! This is a movie recommendation system I made using Python and Streamlit.

You just select a movie, and it shows you 5 similar movies with posters — all fetched using the TMDB API.

Try it and let me know.

🛠️ What I Used

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn (for cosine similarity)
- Streamlit (to build the web app)
- TMDB API (to fetch posters)


✅ To Do (Maybe Later 😄)
	•	Add search bar
	•	Make it look cooler
	•	Add rating-based recommendations
